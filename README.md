# CAGED - CLimate and Geological Dispatch

This was a project built around the NASA EONET API service, to resolve data about climate and geological events around the world. The front end is built in React and takes components from the Material UI library, and the project uses RESTFUL API with Axios to dynamically resolve data. The site features algorithms to call data according to event type, date, and whether a current or past event. There is also a separate live text filter to return quick results from the data already held in state.
